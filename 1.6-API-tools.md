## Chrome Extensions
###  [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en) Makes JSON responses readable in the browser

Turn this ugly mess.

Into something much more useful.

### [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)

A tool that makes it easy to explore, test and experiment with APIs in the browser.

## Command line tools

### curl
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) curl is a command line tool for transfering data with URL syntax. It is very flexible and gives you a great deal of flexibility when sending URL requests.

```shell
curl http://mirzu.fourword.webchefs.org/api/blogposts
```

useful Flags
`-X, --request <command>` Send a specific request method.
```shell
curl -X OPTIONS http://mirzu.fourword.webchefs.org/api/blogposts
```

`-i, --include` Include header in output.
```shell
curl -X OPTIONS -i http://mirzu.fourword.webchefs.org/api/blogposts
```

`-O, --remote-name` Save the output into a file named after the url.
```shell
curl -X OPTIONS -i -O http://mirzu.fourword.webchefs.org/api/blogposts
```

`-u, --user <user:password>` Send a username and password.
```shell
curl -u fk:fkbuild http://mirzu.fourword.webchefs.org/api/blogposts
```
There are many, many more options available that will allow very powerful manipulations how requests to URLs are crafted.

## Resty
A really useful little wrapper for curl that makes life easier when working with an API.

It's really simple to install:

    $ curl -L http://github.com/micha/resty/raw/master/resty > resty

Then source the script

    $ . resty

Now just set the REST host to your api endpoint.

    $ resty http://vagrant.restful.local.dev:8080/api

Now you can make REST requests on the commandline.

    $ GET /

Well that isn't terribly pretty, now is it? There are some ways using python and perl that make it easy to pretty print, but they are hard to remember.

    $ brew install yajl

    or

    $ sudo apt-get install yajl-tools

Now you can pretty print with a command that is easy to remember.

    $ GET / | json_reformat
